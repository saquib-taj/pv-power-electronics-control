V_out.png is the ripple in Capacitor Voltage.

I_ind.png is the ripple in Inductor Current.

I_ind & V_out Ripple.png verifies that the ripple values are around 15% in Inductor Current and 0.2% in Capacitor Voltage.

Figure_2.png shows Inductor Current and Capacitor Voltage for two time periods in steady state.
