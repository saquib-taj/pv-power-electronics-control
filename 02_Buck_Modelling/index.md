# Buck Converter (Open Loop)

## Objective
Model and simulate an open-loop DC–DC buck converter.

## Model
- PWM duty cycle was set in open loop to step down the input voltage.
- Steady-state behaviour was analysed

## Implementation
- MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical

## Results
- Output voltage close to theoretical:  𝑉_𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝐷⋅𝑉_𝑖𝑛
- Inductor current and capacitor voltage waveforms obtained
- Inductor current ripple and output voltage ripple measured in the steady state
