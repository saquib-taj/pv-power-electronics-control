Objective:
Model and simulate an open-loop DC–DC buck converter and study its steady-state behaviour.

Method:
A buck converter was modelled in MATLAB/Simulink using Simscape Electrical. The PWM duty cycle was set in open loop to step down the input voltage.

Results:
  • Output voltage close to theoretical:  𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝐷⋅𝑉𝑖𝑛
  • Inductor current and capacitor voltage waveforms obtained
  • Inductor current ripple and output voltage ripple measured in the steady state

Tools:
MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical
