# Buck Converter (Closed Loop)

## Objective
Design and analyse a closed-loop DC–DC buck converter for voltage regulation.

## Model
- A Proportional-Integral (PI) controller is used.
- Closed-loop voltage control using a PI controller for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

## Implementation
- MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical

## Results
- Closed-loop voltage regulation achieved
- Load and reference step responses evaluated
- Inductor current and output voltage dynamics observed
