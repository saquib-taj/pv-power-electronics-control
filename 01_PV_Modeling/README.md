# PV Modelling

Objective:
Model a photovoltaic module and analyse its electrical behaviour.

Method:
A PV module was modelled in MATLAB/Simulink using Simscape Electrical. Load resistance was swept to obtain I窶天 and P窶天 characteristics.

Results:
- I窶天 and P窶天 curves generated
- Voc, Isc, and MPP identified
- Vmpp, Impp, and Pmax extracted numerically

Tools:
MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical
