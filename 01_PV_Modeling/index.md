# PV Module Modeling

## Objective
Model a photovoltaic module and analyse its electrical behaviour.

## Model
- Load resistance was swept to obtain I窶天 and P窶天 characteristics.
- Temperature & irradiance variation studied

## Implementation
- MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical

## Results
- I窶天 and P窶天 curves generated
- V_oc, I_sc, and MPP identified
- V_mpp, I_mpp, and P_max calculated numerically
