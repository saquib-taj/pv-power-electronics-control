# PV Module Modeling

## Objective
Model a photovoltaic module and analyse its electrical behaviour.

## Model
- Load resistance was swept to obtain I窶天 and P窶天 characteristics.
- Temperature & irradiance variation studied

## Implementation
- MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape Electrical

## Results
- I窶天 and P窶天 curves generated
- Voc, Isc, and MPP identified
- Vmpp, Impp, and Pmax extracted numerically
