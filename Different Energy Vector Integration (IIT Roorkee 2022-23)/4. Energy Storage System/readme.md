Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)

- The primary purpose of energy storage is to capture excess energy when it is abundant and release it when demand is high, ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply.
- A bi-directional DC-DC converter is a specialized electronic device capable of both stepping up (boosting) and stepping down (bucking) the voltage levels as needed.
  - When Q1 is switched ON, and Q2 is switched OFF → Buck Mode operation and thus can be used for charging the battery.
  - When Q2 is switched ON, and Q1 is switched OFF → Boost Mode operation and thus can be used for supplying the load.
